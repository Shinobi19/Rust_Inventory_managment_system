Features:

Add, edit, and delete products.

Record sales and purchases.

(Optional) Generate reports on inventory and sales (future implementation).

Technology Stack:

Rust Programming Language

(Optional) Dialoguer crate (for text-based user interface)

Getting Started:

Prerequisites:

Install Rust from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

(Optional) Install dialoguer crate using cargo install dialoguer

Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://<your_github_repo_url>

cd inventory-management.

Run the Program:
Bash
cargo run.

How to Use:

The program presents a menu-driven interface. Use the arrow keys to navigate and Enter to select an option.

Manage Inventory:

Add Product: Enter product details like name, description, price, and quantity.

Note:

This is a work-in-progress project. Sales, purchase recording, and report generation functionalities are planned for future development.

Currently, data is stored in-memory. Persistence using files or databases will be implemented later.
